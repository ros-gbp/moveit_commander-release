  * [feat] Add the possibility to choose description file #43 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_commander/issues/43>
  * [improve] support pyassimp 3.2. Looks like they changed their import path. robot_description should not be hardcoded to allow changing the name of the description file. This is usefull when working with several robots that do not share the same description file. #45 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_commander/issues/45>
  * [improve] add queue_size option in planning_scene_interface.py #41 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_commander/issues/41>
